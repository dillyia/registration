# Intro

The Human Genomics Club is an academic group founded by 2 current graduate students with deep interest in human genomics. Despite the grand name, at the moment membership to the club is rather exclusive.

# Mission

The Club has the following missions:
1. Promote academic excellence and best practices (including but not limited to experimental design, sequencing protocol, and reproducible code)
2. Facilitate in-depth communication between dry lab scientists to spark creative thinking
3. Accumulate and synthesize learning resources for wet lab biologists who are interested to enter the field
4. Foster collaboration, especially between wet lab biologists and dry lab computational scientists

# Eligibility

It requires long-term commitment to reach the goals mentioned above. We hope to recruit a small group of core members, who can actively engage in the Club's activities and accumulate resources for future comers. When time comes, the Club will expand the audience to a wider community.

We are looking for people with the following characteristics:
1. Has active academic interest in human genomics
2. Is currently involved in the analysis of genomics data
3. Is experienced in computation
4. Agrees that there is an unmet and almost urgent need of the above highlighted missions
5. Is enthusiastic about education and public engagement

# How to

To apply for membership, you will need to write a script in your favourite language, which produces a text output that demonstrate the following skills and knowledge:
1. Knows how to use Git (or other forms of version control)
2. Knows how to parameterize your script
3. Understand the proper definition of p-value, and comment on the meaning of confidence intervals
4. Readability of your script (please do not obfuscate your code for fun, thank you) <sup>although it is very fun indeed</sup>
5. 1-2 sentence summary of the scientific question you are working on, and the type(s) of omics data you are dealing with / dealt with

After you have finished your script, create a branch from this repo and commit both your script and text output. We will try to confirm the receipt within 1 week. We have also attached a pseudocode in this repo as an example of what we expect.

Last but not least, we would be very grateful if you could also comment on our [missions](#mission), and tell us your stories or personal encounters that are related to the points highlighted above.
